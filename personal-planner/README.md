# Description

This is a react web app created for the NTNU course IT2810 - Webutvikling, by group 34.

We got the idea for this application from a friend who told us that her student
housing desperately needed an app for administrating the usage of their bathroom
and other facities in their house. As it is today, if someone has a lecture at the
same time in the morning the bathroom is naturally occupied and sometimes there is 
no time to shower. 

She wanted an application where all students in the house could book the different
facilites based on when they start and end school. This way it would be much easier
to plan dinner, showers and even parties.

To solve this we have created the basics of an application where you are met with a page that
displays a "todo-list", notes, and a calendar with room bookings.
